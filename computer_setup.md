# Computer Setup

General setup for your laptop and related equipment.

1. Be prepared to take your laptop with you wherever you go. Invest in a comfortable bag with ergonomic straps.
2. Bring a laptop and phone charger with you.
3. If you have a mifi (recommended), set it up on your laptop before you actually need to use it.
4. Make sure you have access to all the necessary VPNs, password trackers, and related systems.
5. Install [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/). It's worth it for those 3 am pages.
6. When you're home for the evening, if at all possible, go ahead and have your laptop set up and ready to go.  That way you're not fumbling to get it out of your bag and plugged in, etc. at 3 A.M.
