# The On Call Handbook

Hello!

Is this your first time on call? Or, perhaps not your first rodeo, but you want to see what others are doing with theirs? You're in the right place.

While on call shouldn't a soul-destroying experience, some rotations are heavier than others, and there are things you can do to make your life easier.

This is a collection of tips and tricks to get you through your rotation from people who have been there.

Pull requests gladly accepted.
