# Relaxation

On-call can be *stressful*. Whether you're getting hammered with pages or you only got one (but it was at 3 am) getting into a relaxed and sleepy frame of mind can be difficult.

Here are some suggestions and resources to help you relax:

* Try [Sleepytime Tea](http://www.celestialseasonings.com/products/herbal/sleepytime-classic). Placebo effect or not, having a soothing routine at night is helpful.

* Watch some [Joy of Painting](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxcnsr1R5Ge_fbTu5ajt8DQ) episodes. They're all online for free.

* Put on some customizable [white noise](https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/whiteNoiseGenerator.php).

* Dive into a [classic novel](https://www.gutenberg.org/).
