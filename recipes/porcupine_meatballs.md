# Porcupine Meatballs

(Not made out of porcupines. I can't believe I'm even having to explain this.)

These meatballs have rice right in them, so they sort of count as a meat and a side dish all in one.  Make a big batch and then use in a variety of ways throughout the week - on their own, meatball sandwiches, covered in cheese, eaten cold, etc.

## Ingredients

1/2 cup uncooked long grain rice

1/2 cup water

1/3 cup chopped onion

1 teaspoon salt

1/2 teaspoon celery salt (I don't know that I have EVER put this in?!?)

1/8 teaspoon pepper

1/8 teaspoon garlic powder

1 pound ground beef

2 tablespoons vegetable oil

1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce

1 cup water

2 tablespoons brown sugar

2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce

## Directions

In a bowl, combine the beef and all of the ingredients listed before it. Shape into 1 1/2 inch balls. In a large skillet, brown meatballs in oil; drain. Combine tomato sauce, water, brown sugar and Worcestshire sauce; pour over meatballs. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 1 hour.

In a pinch, you could use approximately 15 ounces of jarred spaghetti sauce and a cup of water for the cooking liquid.
