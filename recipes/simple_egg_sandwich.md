# Simple egg sandwich

This is a very simple egg sandwich which you can make in less than 15
minutes, and is pretty easy to carry and eat on the go. It also reheats fairly well
as long as you can eat it on the same day. If you've got a
long trip in to the office or the datacenter, this may be good to eat in
the car or on the bus.

## Ingredients

2 large eggs

Some kind of breakfast sandwich bun (I like English muffins, but have used a variety of things including a pair of crumpets for this)

Salt

Pepper

Olive oil

1 clove of garlic, minced (optional)

Slice of cheddar cheese (optional)

Aluminum foil or parchment paper (optional, to wrap the sandwich)

## Directions

1. Break both eggs in a bowl, and beat with a fork until well mixed.
Season with salt and pepper in the bowl. If you'd like garlic in the sandwich,
mince it and set it aside.

2. Heat 2 tsp of olive oil in a pan on medium-high.

3. Halve the sandwich bun and start it toasting. If you have a toaster oven and a slice of cheese,
feel free to put the cheese on the inner side of one half of the bun to melt it on.

4. Pour the eggs into the pan. Stir occasionally.

5. Within a minute or so, the eggs will start to solidify. Turn heat down to medium low.
If you have garlic, add it to the pan now so it gets incorporated into the eggs.

6. Fold the eggs over themselves until fully cooked, careful not to break them up.
The goal is to keep the eggs together as a single piece, rather than ending up
with a jumble of scrambled eggs.

7. Once fully cooked, place the eggs on one half of the sandwich bun.
Top with the cheese (if not melted onto the bun) and the other half of the sandwich bun.

8. If you're on the go, wrap the sandwich in aluminum foil or parchment paper
for easy travel.

At this point, you have a sandwich to eat as you head into work to fix the things!
