# General Prep

Pretend you're about to come down with a debilitating yet temporary disease.

1. Clear your calendar. Nothing sucks like getting paged at the movies.
2. Clean up your home and do the dishes. You may not have time in the evenings to catch up during the week.
3. Consider making some food head of time (recipes welcome!).
4. Stock up on easy to make foods. Soups, crackers, pasta, ready-to-bake pizza, frozen veggies.
5. Get your errands done before you go on-call. Buy pet food, get groceries, pick up the dry cleaning, etc. You may not have time to do it during your rotation, and you don't want to lug all your equipment around while you do it. It is okay to take off thirty minutes early to get these errands done before you go on-call.
