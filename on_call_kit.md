# On-call Kit Setup

General setup for your laptop and related equipment.

It's helpful to have a checklist that you run through prior to going on-call to make sure everthing is in order.

1. Be prepared to take your laptop with you wherever you go. Invest in a comfortable bag with ergonomic straps. If you drive most places consider getting a laptop sleeve and put your laptop in the sleeve in the map pocket behind your seat.
2. Bring a laptop and phone charger with you. Also consider purchasing a USB battery pack. They are readily available these days, and fairly inexpensive. Being able to charge your phone while on the go instead of having to be tethered to a wall socket is useful. Make sure to add an item to your checklist to charge this pack prior to going on-call.
3. If you have a mifi (recommended), set it up on your laptop before you actually need to use it.
4. Make sure you have access to all the necessary VPNs, password trackers, and related systems.
5. Install [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/). It's worth it for those 3 am pages.
6. When you're home for the evening, if at all possible, go ahead and have your laptop set up and ready to go. That way you're not fumbling to get it out of your bag and plugged in, etc. at 3 A.M.
7. A hands-free kit for your phone, whether this be the headphones that came with it or a bluetooth earpiece. Make sure you've tested it with your phone in advance of going on-call. It's good to keep your hands available in case you need to call up a colleague or join a conference call.
7. A smart watch (pebble, Apple watch, etc.) can be helpful for late night alerts. The vibration of a smart watch will wake only you up where an audible alert from your phone might also wake up your partner as well.
